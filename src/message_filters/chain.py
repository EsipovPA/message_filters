    The Chain filter provides a container for simple filters.
    It allows you to store an N-long set of filters inside a single
    structure, making it much easier to manage them.

    Adding filters to the chain is done by adding shared_ptrs of them
    to the filter. They are automatically connected to each other
    and the output of the last filter in the chain is forwarded
    to the callback you've registered with Chain::registerCallback.
